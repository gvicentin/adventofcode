# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022.

## Run

All binaries can be run with the `--test` flag. This will only execute the test suite
and exit.

```sh
# compile everything
make compile

# run test
./build/day1 --test

# find challenge's answer
./build/day1 < input/day1.in
```
